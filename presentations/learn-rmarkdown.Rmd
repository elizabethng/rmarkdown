# What is R Markdown?

Markdown is a syntax that allows you write readable text that is translated into a desired output (e.g. HTML, LaTeX, Word) using [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).

  - The R part just means that the file is also capable of running R code as it "knits" (and other languages!)
  

LaTeX is really powerful for formatting, but still requires users to run analyses elsewhere, and then import numbers/figures etc. 

R Markdown allows you to seamlessly integrate your analysis into your report, by taking R Markdown, and passing it to pandoc
  
The power of pandoc means that you can use the same .Rmd file to generate a PDF of your paper or an HTML report

# Basics of R Markdown


---

# Creating R Markdown Files

An R Markdown file is defined by the extension .Rmd

  - Create a text file and save as <your-name>.Rmd
  
  - In RStudio, File > New File > R Markdown

An R markdown file has three main components

- Metadata written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
  - This is where options go

- Text
  - The actual Markdown text you're writing

- Code chunks
  - Code to be evaluated (R and just about anything else)

---

# The YAML

The metadata are stored at the start of the document, bracketed by `---`

There are lots of things that go in here, and some outputs allow for different things in here. 


FYI, indentation matters in YAML!

```yaml
---
title: "My Brilliant Paper"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2019-11-03"
output: 
  html_document: default
---
```

---

# The YAML

The `output` section is where you specify what your document will be knit to, and specify options for those outputs. 

The output listed first is what will be produced


```yaml
---
title: "My Brilliant Paper"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2019-11-03"
output: 
  pdf_document: default
  html_document:
    toc: yes
    float_toc: yes
---
```

---


# The Text

Writing text is the same as just about anywhere else, except that you need to code in any formatting (instead of clicking "bold"). 

You can designate headers using levels of `#`

# `#` to create top level

## `##` to create second level, etc.

---

# The Text

.pull-left[
Bullets are as simple as

```
- Item
  - sub item
- Item
  - another
```

- Item
  - sub item
- Item
  - another
  ]
  .pull-right[

Same with numbered lists

```
1. Item
  - sub item
2. Item
  - another
```
1. Item
  - sub item
2. Item
  - another
]

---



# The Text

A few other Markdown text tricks

`*text*` makes text *italicized*

`**text**` for **bold**

`x~i~` for for subscript

`x^2^` for subscript

`[displauy](link)` creates [hyperlinks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html#markdown-syntax)

Color is a little [finiky](https://dr-harper.github.io/rmarkdown-cookbook/font-color.html), this works for html or pdf output

Roses are `$\color{red}{\text{beautiful red}}$`, 
violets are `$\color{blue}{\text{lovely blue}}$`.

Roses are $\color{red}{\text{beautiful red}}$, 
violets are $\color{blue}{\text{lovely blue}}$.

When in doubt, Google the language your knitting to (HTML, LaTeX)
---

# Code Chunks

This is where R Markdown gets fun! Code chunks work the same as any R script 

````markdown
This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:

`r ''````{r}
# make an amazing plot
plot(1:10)
```

```
````

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3,fig.width=3}
plot(1:10)
```

---

# Code Chunks

You can specify lots of options for chunks (see [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf))


````markdown
`r ''````{r my-plot, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 6}
# make an amazing plot
plot(1:10)
```
```
````
```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.height = 2, fig.width = 6}
plot(1:10)
```


---

# Code Chunks

You can set (and override) [chunk options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk_options) in individual chunks. 

For example suppose you want by default 

.pull-left[
- Hide the actual code in each chunk (`echo = FALSE`)

- Hide all warning messages (`warning = FALSE`)

- Cache results (`cache = TRUE`)

- All plots are 6inch wide and 4 inches high (`fig.dim = c(6,4)`)

- And all plots centered (`fig.align = "center"`)

] .pull-right[
At the start of our .Rmd, we can run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  fig.dim = c(6, 4),
  fig.align = "center",
  cache = TRUE
)
```

]


---

# It doesn't have to be r!

R Markdown allows you to run lots of [other kinds of code](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html)!

```{r all-engines}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

---

# Python in .Rmd

The only thing you have to do is change ` ```{r} ` to ` ```{python} `

  - And have python installed correctly



```{python, fig.height = 3}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([0, 2, 1, 4])
plt.show()
```

---


# Code Chunk Paths

One word of warning: For a variety of reasons, by default code in R markdown runs with the working directory set to **where the .Rmd file lives**

This means that `read.csv("data/mydata.csv")` might work in the console, but not in your .Rmd file if it's saved in say `presentations`

`here` solves that! `here::here("data","mydata.csv")` will work the same in a script as it does in a .Rmd file

---


# In-line code

You can also include code in-line instead of as a code chunk using ` `r ` `

This is really handy for inserting numbers into your text

```{r}
my_amazing_result <- 2^2
```


```{markdown, eval = FALSE}
The amazing result of our experiment was `r my_amazing_result`
```

The amazing result of our experiment was `r my_amazing_result`

in-line code can be as complex as want it to be, but once it gets more than one line I usually move things to a chunk. 

---

# Tables

There are lots of options for tables in R Markdown. 

You can write your own by basically drawing them


```{markdown, eval = FALSE}

|species|length| units|
|------:|:-----|-----:|
| cod   |12    | cm   |

```

|species|length| units|
|------:|:-----|-----:|
| cod   |12    | cm   |

This gets pretty cumbersome for anything but the simplest tables

The `knitr::kable` function and `kableExtra` package are the starting point for fancier tables

---


# `kable` and `kableextra`


```{r results= 'asis'}

knitr::kable(head(mtcars), caption = "My Table", format = "html")

```




---

# kableExtra

the `kableExtra` package as lots of options for customizing tables (See examples [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html))

```{r, results = 'asis'}
iris[1:2, ] %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, function(x) {
    cell_spec(x, bold = T, 
              color = spec_color(x, end = 0.9),
              font_size = spec_font_size(x))
  }) %>%
  mutate(Species = cell_spec(
    Species, color = "white", bold = T,
    background = spec_color(1:2, end = 0.9, option = "A", direction = -1)
  )) %>%
  kable(escape = F, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = F)
```


---

# Table Formats

Tables are one area where it matters what format you're knitting to (html/PDF/word). 

First, in the code chunk that is displaying the table, you need to add ` ```{r table-chunk,results = "asis"``` ` to the code chunk. 

Then, when you call the table, you need to specify what format you are knitting to. I usually write a function for this 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tabfoo <- function(is_html = knitr::is_html_output()){
if (is_html){
  output_format <- "html"
}  else {
  output_format <- "latex"
}
return(output_format)
}


knitr::kable(head(mtcars,2), format = tabfoo())

```


---

# Table packages

knitr::kable
- The basics

[kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html)
  - Customizing kable tables
  
[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)
  - Really customizable tables
  
[stargazer](https://www.jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer/)
  - Nice package for formatting regression results
  - Apparently in hibernation?
  
[xtable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf)
  - Another option for regression tables

[huxtable/huxreg](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxreg.html)
  - Yet another nice option
  
[finalfit](https://finalfit.org/)
  - And another option, looks promising

[]

---

# Equations

Equations are written in LaTeX format and displayed using mathjax. 

Inline equations are written as &#36;equation$, e.g.  &#36;x = \beta^2$ produces $x = \beta^2$

Centered equations are the same, just with two dollar signs

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

---

# Debugging

Debugging can be a little tricky in R Markdown, especially for longer documents. 

It will often give you a helpful error message

If it fails, look at the .log file that is generated and see if that gives you a clue where the problem is

You can also set `error=TRUE` in chunk options if you've got a problematic chunk but want the document to knit anyway

When in doubt, start commenting sections out to isolate the problem

---

# Debugging

shift+command+c on Mac...

```markdown
<!-- You can comment out code! -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # why is this broken?? -->
<!-- x = 2 + @ -->
<!-- ``` -->

```


---

# Spell Check

There's a spellchecker built right into RStudio!

Just click the "ABC" button in the toolbar. You can even add custom dictionaries!

There are also packages for [word counts & readability](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin)


---

# Exercise

That's R Markdown in a nutshell!

1. Create a new .Rmd file

2. Check out the R Markdown [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

3. Choose some options from the cheatsheet and play around with implementing them in your file

Suggestions
  - set up document to knit to HTML, PDF, and Word
    - Customize a setting for PDF
  - Turn off section numbering
  - Set global option for your .Rmd such that
    - All figures have width 3
    - Contents of code chunks are not displayed
  - Run a regression
    - Plot an aspect of your regression
    - Create a summary table using `stargazer` or `xtable`
    - Reference the result of your regression in an inline code snippet

# Papers with R Markdown

Now that we've got the basics down, let's focus on what we care about in the Ivory Tower: writing papers!

We're going to focus on PDF output here

  - We're a while out from the (my) dream of dynamic HTML documents being the default format for papers
  
  - R Markdown to Word works, but frankly I don't use it
    - help [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html)
    
  - Journals generally let you upload files as PDF or LaTeX 

**All the solutions we go over here will work for most any format, the trick is making it look nice**

---

# Introducing `bookdown`

[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) is an amazing package by Yihui Xie that moves R Markdown from handy for reports and homework to ready-for-publication (e.g R for Data Science is written in bookdown)

Knitting using bookdown is as easy adding a "2" to the format you want, and specifying it comes from bookdown


```yaml
---
title: "My Brilliant Paper"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2019-11-03"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2: default
  bookdown::pdf_document2: default
  bookdown::word_document2: default
---
```


---


# Cross-References

There's an entire [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) on bookdown. 

Cross-referencing is the main extension that makes bookdown my default method of papers.
  - Figures
  - Tables
  - Equations
  - Text
  - Sections

---

# Cross Referencing Figures

1. Add a (legally named) label to the chunk printing the figure (e.g. main-fig)
  - `This is my cool figure!` won't work

2. Include `fig.cap = "My Figure Caption"` in the chunk options (you need this if you want to cross reference)

3. Reference the chunk in your text using 

```{markdown, eval = FALSE}
As you can see in Fig.\@ref(fig:main-fig)
```

This will produce "As you can see in Fig.*number of the figure*"
  - Automatically keeps track of the order of your figures!

---

# Cross Referencing Tables

Tables work just about the same way. 

1. Add a (legally named) label to the chunk printing the figure (e.g. main-table)

2. Include a caption/label in the appropriate manner for the function used
  - knitr::kable(my_table, caption = "A sweet table")
  - stargazer::stargazer(my_table, title = "A sweet table",label = "tab:main-table")

2. Reference the chunk in your text using 

```{markdown, eval = FALSE}
As you can see in Table.\@ref(tab:main-table)
```

This will produce "As you can see in Table.*number of the table*"


---

# Cross Referencing Equations

Cross referencing equations requires writing them a bit differently (it's just LaTeX syntax)

```markdown

Also see Equation \@ref(eq:mean).

\begin{equation}
\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} (\#eq:mean)
\end{equation}
```


---

# Theorems

bookdown supports [theorems](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#theorems), proofs, etc!



---




# Cross-Referencing Sections

You can label sections/text and cross reference that as well. 

```markdown


## Introduction {#intro}

This work is important

## Methods {#methods}

As you can see in the [Introduction](intro), this work is important. Here's how we did it. 

## Conclusion

Based on our amazing methods (Section.\@ref(methods)).. we show that

```

---

# Citations

R Markdown (and bookdown) will take care of formatting your citations for you, as long as you help it a bit. 

1. Use a reference manager (such as zotero/mendeley/endnote) to organize your references
  - needs to produce some sort of citation key
  - I use [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) with [betterbibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex)

2. Export the references you want in your paper to a .bib file
  - other formats are supported
  - Easiest to put it wherever the .Rmd lives

3. Reference the .bib file in your YAML

4. Select a citation style
  - By default uses Chicago author-date format
  - Other styles can be passed using a .csl file
    - zotero maintains a [style repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles) to download the .csl you need


---


# Citations

```yaml
---
title: "My Brilliant Paper"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "2019-11-03"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2: default
  bookdown::pdf_document2: default
  bookdown::word_document2: default
bibliography: references.bib
csl: fish-and-fisheries.csl
---
```

---


# Citations

Citing references works similarly to all other cross referencing, with a few other tricks. Standard citations go in brackets, separated by semicolons. Don't worry about order. 

```markdown
Fishes are delicious [@aristotle320BC;@cat2019]
```
 
You can include other text in there as well

```markdown
Fishes are delicious [see @aristotle320BC;@cat2019 pp. 33-35]
```

For in-text citations just omit the `[`

```markdown

@bob2019 is wrong. 

```

---

# Formatting Your Document

There are a bunch of standard options you can add to the YAML that work with most outputs (like toc: true)

### HTML
You can specify a [`theme`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) in the YAML, and add your own .css file in the YAML `css: my-theme.css`

#### Word
You can format a document in Word the way you like it, and save it as a [reference_docx](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html)
#### PDF
You can write your own LaTeX templates, or use [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles)

---


# rticles

The rticles package has numerous templates for different journals (but not even close to all), including broad categories like Elsevier.

`install.packages(rticles)`

Easiest way from there is in RStudio

1. File>New File>R Markdown

2. Select "From Template"

3. Select the journal template you want


This will set the file up to be rendered in the format for the journal. Usually, you'll actually end up submitting the generated .tex file and support files, but R Markdown will take care of creating those for you. 

**rticles is open source, so check the results**!

---


# Customizing LaTeX Templates

If you look through the rticles website there are some great examples of turning a new LaTeX template into an rticles template. They welcome submissions!

Alternatively, you can pass pass your own files to augment the default template

```yaml
---
title: "My Paper"
output:
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    includes:
      in_header: preamble.tex
      before_body: doc-prefix.tex
      after_body: doc-suffix.tex
---
```

---

# Customizing LaTeX templates

You can also replace the default template entirely

This requires some serious LaTeX skills, and is beyond this class

Thankfully, someone already did the work of translating the UW LaTeX template to R Markdown! [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown)


```yaml
---
title: "My Paper"
output:
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
       template: dissertation.tex
---
```


---

# Submitting Journal Articles (or Dissertations)

Journals have varying degrees of requirements for submission. 

If there's an rticles template, often you can use that, and then submit the required .tex files (and supporting files)
  - Some journals just want the PDF

If the journal doesn't care about formatting, but requires editable formats (LaTeX, Word), then you can usually just knit the document

  - set `keep_tex: true` if knitting to PDF and submitting LaTeX
  - Just knit to Word and submit the .docx!
    - Especially if you have complex tables etc, make sure that the knit to Word worked
    - Can always do some manual improvements in Word at submission time, but try to keep these to a minimum
    

---

# Dissertations

University's tend to be sticklers about formatting dissertations. 

Many, including University of Washington, have LaTeX templates you can use, and a growing number of people are converting them to R Markdown templates

* [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown)

* [gauchodown](https://github.com/DanOvando/gauchodown)

---


# Dissertations in R Markdown

Writing your dissertation in R Markdown 
  * Makes it easy to incorporate last-minute changes
  
  * Helps you remember what you did
  
  * Sets you up to convert chapters to publications
  
  * Saves you from spending the last few weeks of your PhD formatting things
  
  * Allows you to easily export your dissertation as a [webpage](https://danovando.github.io/dissertation/)
  
  * Makes it harder(ish) to collaborate...
---

# Editing and Collaboration

Collaboration is the hardest part using R Markdown for collaborative writing. 

Tradeoff between replicability and ease of editing. 

The "best" option

1. Design a project-oriented workflow with GitHub

2. Have co-authors create a branch for their edits

3. Co-authors submit a pull request with their edits

4. Lead author reviews pull requests and accepts/rejects

5. Co-authors either create a new branch for the next round of edits, or rebase their edit branch

This sounds nightmare-ish, but imagine if you'd never heard of word before, and someone suggested that you incorporate edits by collating results of a bunch of emails, a random subset of which build on each other, back into your original document...

---

# Editing and Collaboration

Alternative options I've seen

* Email around edits on the .Rmd itself 

* Only write the methods/results in R Markdown, "text heavy" sections in Word/whatever
  * Stitch together as best you can
  
* There is a package called [redoc](https://noamross.github.io/redoc/) in the works that allows you to knit to Word, get edits from authors, then pull updated document (with track changes) back into Word!
  * Very beta

* Send knitted docs to authors, and manually incorporate changes into .Rmd :(


---

# Editing and Collaboration

Evaluate each project and consider which pain is worse:

- Keeping graphs, numbers, etc. up to date and reproducible

- Incorporating co-author edits


```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("homer.gif")
```


---

# A note on cacheing

R markdown lets you cache results for none, all, or some code chunks. 

I often use it when I'm focusing on formatting (don't want to wait 20min to see if my new LaTeX template worked)

Cacheing is not a substitute for reproducibility!

- By default cached chunks won't rerun if code in them has changed
  - What if dependent code has changed?
  
**Use cacheing for development, always clear cache and do a clean run before submitting!**


---

# Workflow Tips

Simple analysis = All in R Markdown

Complex analysis = Scripts to R Markdown

1. Write a script to run analysis, save key results

  - I like to create versioned sub-directories, e.g. `results/v1.0`
  
  - If it's small enough, `save.image` is great
  
2. Write paper in .Rmd, with `parameters`

```yaml
title: My Great Paper
params:
  results_name: ["v1.0"]
  sim_years: [50]
  burn_years: [20]
  num_patches: [25]
```

---


# Workflow Tips

Parameters help seamlessly generate documents as results change

Inside the .Rmd, I'll load the relevant results (in this case `results.rds`)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
results <- readRDS(here("results",params$results_name,"results.rds"))
```

And then use my results to make plots, summary tables, etc (often saving those as plots/objects as well along the way)

So, in the last line of my script, I'll write

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render(here("documents", "my-paper.Rmd"), 
                  params = list(run_name = "v1.0"))

```

If you've done it all right, by sourcing your main script, you go from raw data to submission-ready paper with one command!

---


# Exercise - Pretend Paper

1. Create a GitHub repo containing a new .Rmd
  - See if there's an rticles template for a journal you use

2. Read in some data (I've added some to data folder)

3. Write an introduction section with at least one reference

4. Write a methods section with a numbered equation

5. Write a results section with at least one figure and table

6. Write a discussion section that references the figure and table

7. Save the figure and the table in your results folder

8. knit the paper to a few different formats and compare results

9. Team up! Push your paper to GitHub
  - Have each person create a branch of the other paper, make edits, submit pull request
  - Have each author review, accept/reject edits

# Bonus Things

# Presentations with R Markdown
 
 You've already been coerced into dealing with R Markdown presentations (sorry)
 
 There are lots (too many) ways to do presentations IMO
 
  - [slidy](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/slidy-presentation.html)
  - [beamer](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html)
  - [ioslides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html)
  - R Presentation
  - [Powerpoint](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/powerpoint-presentation.html) (yep!)
  - [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)

All work pretty well, and have all the benefits of using R Markdown
  - No more copy and pasting figures into powerpoint!

---

# Xaringan

For a quick and dirty presentation I like ioslides. 

Downside is that ioslides (and others like it) aren't all that flexible: enter xaringan

> The package name xaringan comes from Sharingan, a dōjutsu in Naruto with two abilities: the "Eye of Insight" and the "Eye of Hypnotism". A presentation ninja should have these basic abilities, and I think remark.js may help you acquire these abilities
>
> --- Yihui Xie (author of bookdown and lots of R Markdown goodness)

---


# Xaringan

xaringan is fully customizable (and looks pretty good out the gate)

  - Real customization requires [learning CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
    - Bonus: sets you up for a career in web design!
  
  - There are several (and growing) [canned themes](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes) you can use, and with this as templates it's not bad to write your own
  
  - I really can't teach it better than the [example](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/)
---


# R Markdown Presentations

One note for any R Markdown presentation: saving is kind of a pain. 

The default is an HTML presentation that you view in a web browser, which is great for presenting from your computer, but tough to share with others (though there are ways, Google!)

Simplest option: Open in Chrome (yes, it really has to be Chrome), select Print, and save to PDF (adjust options to make it look right)

# blogdown

[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is a really cool package for writing R-based blogs!

A reasonable question: Why in the world would you use R to write a blog?

Are we trying to text Nelly with Excel?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://media.giphy.com/media/OgRQGJ3dbuz8A/giphy.gif")
```

# blogdown

IMO, if you just want to post text / CV / etc, blogdown is not the way to go. 

But, if you create lots of code-heavy content, it's amazing

  - Tutorials
  - Summaries of your research with results and figures
  
I used it for [my website](danovando.com), but can't teach it better than the tutorials

- [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

- Allison Hill's [tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/)

cache -- not a great data storage things, need to set up specifically, has code within this chunk changed? but it won't know if there are dependencies among chunks. use it as a debugging tool, not a way to avoid re-running.
Can otpions > clear knitr chache

Another option: eval = FALSE (don't evaluate this chunk)
Can also cause issues with dependencies later, but can be useful to cruise by to get set up correct

Code chunk paths
- by default .rmd treats working directory as where the file is saved, not project
- because pandoc needs to create a bunch of temp files
- but use here::here() which will work in script or in project

LaTeX equations
- can use LaTeX packages

- Debugging in R markdown can be tricky, can set error = TRUE in chuck options to help figure things out (it will continue running if it hits an error in that code chunk)


Dan's workflow
- what do you use rmd projects for?
- more small chunks or fewer bigger ones?
  - mixture of 2: load data, filter data, plot data etc.
  - separate chucks for every figure is useful for cross-referencing
  - same with tables
- simple analysis? all in rmd
- more complicated? run scripts with analysis and then save results which are fed to r markdown

Bookdown
- cross-reference for tables and figures
- only work with bookdown, but there's no downside to using bookdown

Dissertation
- pros and cons
- Dan went that way, dynamic code heavy
- put it together using knit_child
